	| To export a filesystem |
	+------------------------+


[A] ON SERVER:

+ vi /etc/dfs/dfstab, adding a line like one of these:

  share -F nfs -o ro -d "some description" /export/home/users
  share -o rw,root=slefire.ite.ellacoya.com /export/home/sol9/local


+ run this command:

  exportfs -a


[B] ON CLIENT:

+ (for this example, I'm assuming hostname of the server is "obtuse")

+ make a mount point as follows:

  mkdir /export/home/obtuseUsers
  touch /export/home/obtuseUsers/NOT_MOUNTED

  (note: the mount point can be named anything and can be located anywhere
   on your local disk - the above is just and example. Also, the later
   command is not required, it simply lets you easily see whether a mount
   point is mounted or not)

+ vi /etc/vfstab, adding a line like this:

  obtuse:/export/home/users - /export/home/obtuseUsers nfs - yes -

+ mountall

My question dealt with the trouble I was having getting filesystems to mount 
via NFS. Attempts to mount failed with "RPC: Program not registered".

The problem was that nfsd and mountd weren't running.  If turns out that if 
there are no shared entries in /etc/dfs/dfstab, then those daemons aren't 
started at boot time.  The solution I chose was to put the share command in 
/etc/dfs/dfstab, and then execute

      /etc/init.d/nfs.server start

Also, I could have issued the commands manually:

/usr/lib/nfs/nfsd -a 16
/usr/lib/nfs/mountd

This must all be done as root, naturally.

Thanks to all those who responded.
