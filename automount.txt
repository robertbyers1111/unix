The "+auto_master" line means that it automatically includes the entries
from the NIS auto_master map, which is presumably where the /usr/local
automount comes from.  You can override this by putting:

	/usr/local  -null

in /etc/auto_master *before* the "+auto_master" line.

[NOTE: Just edit auto_master, then umount /usr/local; ie, no need to restart any deamons. But,
to restart automounting, I had to stop and restart automounts (/etc/rc2.d/S74autofs)]
