Use 'fuser' to find which pid(s) are listening on a port.

NOTE: Run as root.

EXAMPLE:

    sudo fuser -v 53/tcp
                         USER        PID ACCESS COMMAND
    53/tcp:              root       7785 F.... named
                         named     11321 F.... named
                         named     15657 F.... named
