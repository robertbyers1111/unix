* '+' is NOT a valid SED operator

* '\t\ is NOT a valid escape

* For whitespace, use [SPACE,TAB][SPACE,TAB]*. For example,

	[ 	][ 	]*

* For positional editing, be sure to account for ALL fields from the input !!! Otherwise, trailing data becomes part of your match :(

	echo "abc def xyz" | sed 's/\(.*\)\([ 	][ 	]*\)/\1/'

	Returns the unintended result ..

		abc xyz

	(because the xyz wasn't accounted for in the positional expression)
