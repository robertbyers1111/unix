If you're getting connected, inetd.conf is obviously OK.  All inetd does is
start up the daemon, it has no control over what the daemon does after
that, such as per-user access control.

The files that affect whether a particular user is able to login via FTP
are /etc/ftpusers and /etc/shells.  If a user is in /etc/ftpusers, they're
not allowed to FTP (yes, the file contains the opposite of what its name
implies -- it should have been /etc/ftpnonusers).  Or if a user's login
shell isn't in /etc/shells, they're not allowed to FTP.
