Hi Jeff,

I used to use both PuTTY (for telnet to linux hosts in the lab) and the Cygwin X Server (to allow X applications on my desktop display in my cube).

PuTTY still works for me, but I.m no longer able to launch any X applications from lab linux systems using my desktop.s display. After about a minute or two, I get .Error: cannot open display: 10.1.16.51:0.0.

10.1.16.51 is my cubicle desktop. As before, I have Cygwin X Server up and running, with .xhost +. in my .startxwinrc file. This used to work fine.

From PuTTY, I.ve enabled X11 forwarding. But I get above error every time. 

Also, I tried ssh .Y user@host, and got the same error. In addition, when I log in using this method I get this warning during the login:

      .Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding..

.. is that a clue as to what.s missing?

Thanks for any light you can shed on this!
-Bob

what is the linux machine? The DISPLAY is not correct...

Bob Byers 11:09 AM
I'm using whitewater (172.30.10.229)

Jeff Domogala 11:09 AM
and what is the username?

Bob Byers 11:09 AM
bbyers

Jeff Domogala 11:10 AM
yep... .bashrc is hosed
standby... ill fix it
try to open up a new session now
if you "echo DISPLAY", it should say "whitewater:10.0"

Bob Byers 11:24 AM
but whitewater is not my desktop, it is the remote system to which I'm ssh'ing. I want to set the display to be my desktop PC (10.1.16.51)

Jeff Domogala 11:24 AM
yep
with ssh the display is the ssh tunnel on whitewater

Bob Byers 11:25 AM
oh

Jeff Domogala 11:25 AM
you cannot telnet and expect to fire up x windows anymore
you have to ssh -Y user@host
then DISPLAY is set 

Bob Byers 11:25 AM
OK. 

Jeff Domogala 11:25 AM
I commented out the lines in your .bashrc that set DISPLAY

Bob Byers 11:26 AM
will the display variable always use ":10"?

Jeff Domogala 11:26 AM
first tunnel, yes
second is 11, etc...

Bob Byers 11:26 AM
OK
ssh -Y bbyers@172.30.10.229
.. then ..
export DISPLAY=whitewater:10.0
.. now I get ..
Error: Can't open display: whitewater:10.0

Jeff Domogala 11:28 AM
do not export
if things are working right DISPLAY is set automatically
if not, something is still screwed up
ssh onto the machine and "echo DISPLAY"

Bob Byers 11:29 AM
OK that worked!
it is set to "localhost:10.0"

Jeff Domogala 11:30 AM
ok
that's fine
some ssh servers use the hostname, others use localhost

Bob Byers 11:30 AM
I see

Jeff Domogala 11:30 AM
all set?

Bob Byers 11:30 AM
Thanks for the help!

Jeff Domogala 11:30 AM
no problem

Bob Byers 11:30 AM
yes all set
