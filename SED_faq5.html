<h2>5. WHY ISN'T THIS WORKING?</h2>

<a name="s5.1"></a><h3>5.1. Why don't my variables like $var get expanded in my sed script?</h3>

<p>Because your sed script uses 'single quotes' instead of "double
   quotes." Unix shells never expand $variables in single quotes.
</p>
<p>This is probably the most frequently-asked sed question. For more
   info on using variables, see <a href="sedfaq4.html#s4.30">section 4.30</a>.
</p>
<a name="s5.2"></a><h3>5.2. I'm using 'p' to print, but I have duplicate lines sometimes.</h3>

<p>Sed prints the entire file by default, so the 'p' command might
   cause the duplicate lines. If you want the whole file printed,
   try removing the 'p' from commands like 's/foo/bar/p'. If you want
   part of the file printed, run your sed script with -n flag to
   suppress normal output, and rewrite the script to get all output
   from the 'p' comand.
</p>
<p>If you're still getting duplicate lines, you are probably finding
   several matches for the same line. Suppose you want to print lines
   with the words "Peter" or "James" or "John", but not the same line
   twice. The following command will fail:
</p>
<pre class='sed'>
     sed -n '/Peter/p; /James/p; /John/p' files
</pre>

<p>Since all 3 commands of the script are executed for each line,
   you'll get extra lines. A better way is to use the 'd' (delete) or
   'b' (branch) commands, like so (with GNU sed):
</p>
<pre class='sed'>
     sed '/Peter/b; /James/b; /John/b; d' files          # one way
     sed -n '/Peter/{p;d;};/James/{p;d;};/John/p' files  # a 2nd way
     sed -n '/Peter/{p;b;};/James/{p;b;};/John/p' files  # a 3rd way
     sed '/Peter\|James\|John/!d' files                  # shortest way
</pre>

<p>On standard seds, these must be broken down with -e commands:
</p>
<pre class='sed'>
     sed -e '/Peter/b' -e '/James/b' -e '/John/b' -e d files
     sed -n -e '/Peter/{p;d;}' -e '/James/{p;d;}' -e '/John/p' files
</pre>

<p>The 3rd line would require too many -e commands to fit on one line,
   since standard versions of sed require an -e command after each 'b'
   and also after each closing brace '}'.
</p>
<a name="s5.3"></a><h3>5.3. Why does my DOS version of sed process a file part-way through and then quit?</h3>

<p>First, look for errors in the script. Have you used the -n switch
   without telling sed to print anything to the console? Have you read
   the docs to your version of sed to see if it has a syntax you may
   have misused? (Look for an N or H command that gathers too much.)
</p>
<p>Next, if you are sure your sed script is valid, a probable cause is
   an end-of-file marker embedded in the file. An EOF marker (SUB) is
   a Control-Z character, with the value of 1A hex (26 decimal). As
   soon as any DOS version of sed encounters a Ctrl-Z character, sed
   stops processing.
</p>
<p>To locate the EOF character, use Vern Buerg's shareware file viewer
   LIST.COM &lt;<a href="http://www.buerg.com/list.html">http://www.buerg.com/list.html</a>&gt;. In text mode, look for a
   right-arrow symbol; in hex mode (Alt-H), look for a 1A code. With
   Unix utilities ported to DOS, use 'od' (octal dump) to display
   hexcodes in your file, and then use sed to locate the offending
   character:
</p>
<pre>
       od -txC badfile.txt | sed -n "/ 1a /p; / 1a$/p"
</pre>

<p>Then edit the input file to remove the offending character(s).
</p>
<p>If you would rather NOT edit the input file, there is still a fix.
   It requires the DJGPP 32-bit port of 'tr', the Unix translate
   program (v1.22 or higher). GNU od and tr are currently at v2.0 (for
   DOS); they are packaged with the GNU text utilities, available at
</p>
<pre>
       <a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/txt20b.zip">ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/txt20b.zip</a>
       <a href="http://www.simtel.net/gnudlpage.php?product=/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/txt20b.zip&amp;name=txt20b.zip">http://www.simtel.net/gnudlpage.php?product=/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/txt20b.zip&amp;name=txt20b.zip</a>
</pre>

<p>It is important to get the DJGPP version of 'tr' because other
   versions ported to DOS will stop processing when they encounter the
   EOF character. Use the -d (delete) command:
</p>
<pre>
       tr -d \32 &lt; badfile.txt | sed -f myscript.sed
</pre>

<a name="s5.4"></a><h3>5.4. My RE isn't matching/deleting what I want it to. (Or, "Greedy vs. stingy pattern matching")</h3>

<p>The two most common causes for this problem are: (1) misusing the
   '.' metacharacter, and (2) misusing the '*' metacharacter. The RE
   '.*' is designed to be "greedy" (i.e., matching as many characters
   as possible). However, sometimes users need an expression which is
   "stingy," matching the shortest possible string.
</p>
<p>(1) On single-line patterns, the '.' metacharacter matches any
   single character on the line. ('.' cannot match the newline at the
   end of the line because the newline is removed when the line is put
   into the pattern space; sed adds a newline automatically when the
   pattern space is printed.) On multi-line patterns obtained with the
   'N' or 'G' commands, '.' <i>will</i> match a newline in the middle of the
   pattern space. If there are 3 lines in the pattern space, "s/.*//"
   will delete all 3 lines, not just the first one (leaving 1 blank
   line, since the trailing newline is added to the output).
</p>
<p>Normal misuse of '.' occurs in trying to match a word or bounded
   field, and forgetting that '.' will also cross the field limits.
   Suppose you want to delete the first word in braces:
</p>
<pre>
       echo {one} {two} {three} | sed 's/{.*}/{}/'       # fails
       echo {one} {two} {three} | sed 's/{[^}]*}/{}/'    # succeeds
</pre>

<p>'s/{.*}/{}/' is not the solution, since the regex '.' will match
   any character, including the close braces. Replace the '.' with
   '[^}]', which signifies a negated character set '[^...]' containing
   anything other than a right brace. FWIW, we know that 's/{one}/{}/'
   would also solve our question, but we're trying to illustrate the
   use of the negated character set: [^anything-but-this].
</p>
<p>A negated character set should be used for matching words between
   quote marks, for fields separated by commas, and so on. See also
   <a href="sedfaq4.html#s4.12">section 4.12</a> ("How do I parse a comma-delimited data file?").
</p>
<p>(2) The '*' metacharacter represents zero or more instances of the
   previous expression. The '*' metacharacter looks for the leftmost
   possible match first and will match zero characters. Thus,
</p>
<pre>
       echo foo | sed 's/o*/EEE/'
</pre>

<p>will generate 'EEEfoo', not 'fEEE' as one might expect. This is
   because /o*/ matches the null string at the beginning of the word.
</p>
<p>After finding the leftmost possible match, the '*' is GREEDY; it
   always tries to match the longest possible string. When two or
   three instances of '.*' occur in the same RE, the leftmost instance
   will grab the most characters. Consider this example, which uses
   grouping '\(...\)' to save patterns:
</p>
<pre>
       echo bar bat bay bet bit | sed 's/^.*\(b.*\)/\1/'
</pre>

<p>What will be displayed is 'bit', never anything longer, because the
   leftmost '.*' took the longest possible match. Remember this rule:
   "leftmost match, longest possible string, zero also matches."
</p>
<a name="s5.5"></a><h3>5.5. What is CSDPMI*B.ZIP and why do I need it?</h3>

<p>If you use MS-DOS outside of Windows and try to use GNU sed v1.18
   or 3.02, you may encounter the following error message:
</p>
<pre>
       no DPMI - Get csdpmi*b.zip
</pre>

<p>"DPMI" stands for DOS Protected Mode Interface; it's basically a
   means of running DOS in Protected Mode (as opposed to Real Mode),
   which allows programs to share resources in extended memory without
   conflicting with one another. Running HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE is
   not enough. The "CSDPMI*B.ZIP" refers to files written by Charles
   Sandmann to provide DPMI services for 32-bit computers (i.e.,
   386SX, 386DX, 486SX, etc.). Download the binary file (the source
   code is also available):

</pre>

<p>and extract CWSDPMI.EXE, CWSDPR0.EXE and CWSPARAM.EXE from the ZIP
   file. Put all 3 CWS*.EXE files in the same directory as GSED.EXE
   and you're all set. There are DOC files enclosed, but they're
   nearly incomprehensible for the average computer user. (Another
   case of user-vicious documentation.)
</p>
<p>If you're running Windows and you normally use a DOS session to run
   GNU sed (i.e., you get to a DOS prompt with a resizable window or
   you press Alt-Enter to switch to full-screen mode), you don't need
   the CWS*.EXE files at all, since Windows uses DPMI already.
</p>
<a name="s5.6"></a><h3>5.6. Where are the man pages for GNU sed?</h3>

<p>Prior to GNU sed v3.02, there weren't any. Until recently, man
   pages distributed with gsed were borrowed from old sources or from
   other compilations. None of them were "official." GNU sed v3.02 had
   the first real set of official man pages, and the documentation has
   greatly improved with GNU sed version 4.0, which now includes both
   man pages and textinfo pages.
</p>
<a name="s5.7"></a><h3>5.7. How do I tell what version of sed I am using?</h3>

<p>Try entering "sed" all by itself on the command line, followed by
   no arguments or parameters.  Also, try "sed --version".  In a
   pinch, you can also try this:
</p>
<pre>
       strings sed | grep -i ver
</pre>

<p>Your version of 'strings' must be a version of the Unix utility of
   this name. It should not be the DOS utility STRINGS.COM by Douglas
   Boling.
</p>
<a name="s5.8"></a><h3>5.8. Does sed issue an exit code?</h3>

<p>Most versions of sed do not, but check the documentation that came
   with whichever version you are using. GNU sed issues an exit code
   of 0 if the program terminated normally, 1 if there were errors in
   the script, and 2 if there were errors during script execution.
</p>
<a name="s5.9"></a><h3>5.9. The 'r' command isn't inserting the file into the text.</h3>

<p>On most versions of sed (but not all), the 'r' (read) and 'w'
   (write) commands must be followed by exactly one space, then the
   filename, and then terminated by a newline. Any additional
   characters before or after the filename are interpreted as <b>part</b>
   of the filename. Thus
</p>
<pre>
       /RE/r  insert.me
</pre>

<p>will would try to locate a file called ' insert.me' (note the
   leading space!). If the file was not found, most versions of sed
   say nothing, not even an error message.
</p>
<p>When sed scripts are used on the command line, every 'r' and 'w'
   must be the last command in that part of the script. Thus,
</p>
<pre>
       sed -e '/regex/{r insert.file;d;}' source         # will fail
       sed -e '/regex/{r insert.file' -e 'd;}' source    # will succeed
</pre>

<a name="s5.10"></a><h3>5.10. Why can't I match or delete a newline using the \n escape sequence? Why can't I match 2 or more lines using \n?</h3>

<p>The \n will never match the newline at the end-of-line because the
   newline is always stripped off before the line is placed into the
   pattern space. To get 2 or more lines into the pattern space, use
   the 'N' command or something similar (such as 'H;...;g;').
</p>
<p>Sed works like this: sed reads one line at a time, chops off the
   terminating newline, puts what is left into the pattern space where
   the sed script can address or change it, and when the pattern space
   is printed, appends a newline to stdout (or to a file). If the
   pattern space is entirely or partially deleted with 'd' or 'D', the
   newline is <b>not</b> added in such cases. Thus, scripts like
</p>
<pre>
       sed 's/\n//' file       # to delete newlines from each line
       sed 's/\n/foo\n/' file  # to add a word to the end of each line
</pre>

<p>will <i>never</i> work, because the trailing newline is removed <i>before</i>
   the line is put into the pattern space. To perform the above tasks,
   use one of these scripts instead:
</p>
<pre>
       tr -d '\n' &lt; file              # use tr to delete newlines
       sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n//g' file   # GNU sed to delete newlines
       sed 's/$/ foo/' file           # add "foo" to end of each line
</pre>

<p>Since versions of sed other than GNU sed have limits to the size of
   the pattern buffer, the Unix 'tr' utility is to be preferred here.
   If the last line of the file contains a newline, GNU sed will add
   that newline to the output but delete all others, whereas tr will
   delete all newlines.
</p>
<p>To match a block of two or more lines, there are 3 basic choices:
   (1) use the 'N' command to add the Next line to the pattern space;
   (2) use the 'H' command at least twice to append the current line
   to the Hold space, and then retrieve the lines from the hold space
   with x, g, or G; or (3) use address ranges (see <a href="sedfaq3.html#s3.3">section 3.3</a>, above)
   to match lines between two specified addresses.
</p>
<p>Choices (1) and (2) will put an \n into the pattern space, where it
   can be addressed as desired ('s/ABC\nXYZ/alphabet/g'). One example
   of using 'N' to delete a block of lines appears in <a href="sedfaq4.html#s4.13">section 4.13</a>
   ("How do I delete a block of <i>specific</i> consecutive lines?"). This
   example can be modified by changing the delete command to something
   else, like 'p' (print), 'i' (insert), 'c' (change), 'a' (append),
   or 's' (substitute).
</p>
<p>Choice (3) will not put an \n into the pattern space, but it <i>does</i>
   match a block of consecutive lines, so it may be that you don't
   even need the \n to find what you're looking for. Since several
   versions of sed support this syntax:
</p>
<pre>
       sed '/start/,+4d'  # to delete "start" plus the next 4 lines,
</pre>

<p>in addition to the traditional '/from here/,/to there/{...}' range
   addresses, it may be possible to avoid the use of \n entirely.
</p>
<a name="s5.11"></a><h3>5.11. My script aborts with an error message, "event not found".</h3>

<p>This error is generated by the csh or tcsh shells, not by sed. The
   exclamation mark (!) is special to csh/tcsh, and if you use it in
   command-line or shell scripts--even within single quotes--it must
   be preceded by a backslash. Thus, under the csh/tcsh shell:
</p>
<pre>
       sed '/regex/!d'      # will fail
       sed '/regex/\!d'     # will succeed
</pre>

<p>The exclamation mark should not be prefixed with a backslash when
   the script is called from a file, as "-f script.file".
