# Window Manager

NB: Other files that may impact window mgr:

	~/.Xclients-default
	~/.Xclients-*
	~/.xinitrc
	/etc/sysconfig/desktop

DETAILS FOUND ON USENET:

   "The normal start process for RH is to look at .wm_style and it
will start whatever window manager you select there.  RH
distributes 4 window managers on its CD's if you loaded all 4
then you can start them by editing only .wm_style.  

   BTW: If .wm_style is not set then the startup defaults into
Fvwm95 - RH is not real explicit about this.  It's too bad as
.wm_style is the key to getting windomanager flavors in RH and
their startup scripts expect a value in there.

   For running KDE.  RH runs xinit which invokes xinitrc which
calls Xclient.  I forget which one it is but one of the two
checks for a local .Xclients in your home dir.  If its found its
executes.  Normally RH does not put an .Xclients in any home dir
(obviously) but just in case I mention it for root.  KDE puts a
.Xclients in your home dir which can be copied to users home dir
to start KDE insted of whats in .wm_style.  When you have KDE and
the KDE .Xclients file in your home dir it over-rides .wm_style. 
It actually avoids it and does a start_kde.  But this makes
switching managers flexable.  .wm_style and easily be set so if
you copy .Xclients to .Xclients.kde anytime you want to revert to
the manager in .wm_style you can delete .Xclients.  To
reconfigure KDE just copy .Xclients.kde to .Xclients"

ALSO FROM SAME THREAD:

   "Easiest way to do this is to log in as the user you want --i.e.,
root-- and then type 'usekde' at the command line. That'll take care
of it."
