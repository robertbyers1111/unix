[1] network manager service

    % sudo service network-manager restart

[2] systemd

The service command is just a wrapper for this method (and also for init.d scripts and Upstart commands). The systemctl
command is much more versatile than service. This is what I usually prefer.

    % sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service

[3] nmcli

    % sudo nmcli networking off
    % sudo nmcli networking on

[4] ifup & ifdown

    % sudo ifdown -a && sudo ifup -a
