Additional information:

- 172.17.1.1 is server IP address. This is the server (better to use SBCâ€™s sip interface) using the certificate that we extracted the private key from.

- 443 (for TLS default is 5061) is the TCP port at the server side.

- http (in our case SIP)  is the protocol carried inside the SSL/TLS session

- c:\tls\keyout.pem is the name of the file which includes the converted private key

- c:\tls\debug2.txt is the name of the file which includes information about the decryption process
