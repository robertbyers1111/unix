-w deadline
Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of
how many packets have been sent or received. In this case ping
does not stop after count packet are sent, it waits either for
deadline expire or until count probes are answered or for some
error notification from network.

-W timeout
Time to wait for a response, in seconds. The option affects only
timeout in absence of any responses, otherwise ping waits for
two RTTs.
