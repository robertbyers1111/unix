How to Change Your Hostname In Solaris

Sometimes even the simplest tasks, like changing your IP address or hostname
can be every-so- vexing. First off, there is a handy little utility called
hostconfig which is used for, you guessed it, editing the host information of
your Solaris box. Typing it with no arguments will spit out some usage. You can
achieve the same effect by editing the listed files below and then rebooting.
Also note the very handy commands sysconfig and sysunconfig.

/etc/hosts
Vastly more important in Solaris than it is in Linux. This is where you specify
the IP address of your hostname. Change the hostname here to match your hosts
new name. It should be the same as what you specify in /etc/nodename.

/etc/nodename
This is just like /etc/HOSTNAME in Linux. It defines the realname of the host.
Simply change it to whatever you want to call your host.

/etc/hostname.hme0 (or other interface name)
Change these to line up with what you specified in /etc/hosts. 

/etc/net/tic*/hosts
Change everything in here to line up with the files above. 

/etc/resolv.conf
Just like Linux. This is where you specify your DNS servers and domain
resolution information. 

/etc/defaultrouter
Simply put the IP address of the default router for your solaris host. Note
that Sun does not create this file by default, nor is there any other location
where you may specify a default route.
