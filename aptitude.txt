Note that with the new multi-arch packages, you'll get packages for other
architectures listed in this result. For example, I get:

aptitude -F "%p" search "?not(?installed)"  | grep "^bash:"
bash:i386

I have the bash package installed, but it's the amd64 version, since my OS is
installed with the amd64 version of Ubuntu Precise. If you don't want to see
these packages for other architectures, you can exclude lines containing ::

aptitude -F "%p" search "?not(?installed)"  | grep -v ':'

Interactive Use

To run interactively, enter the following from a terminal:

aptitude

After running it, use:

    F10 to access the menu and use aptitude. This is the main key.
    ? for help
    The 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right' keys to navigate.
    The 'Enter' key to select
    The '+' or '-' key to install/update or remove a package
    The 'g' key to preview/confirm actions
    'q' to quit – this also closes the currently open window (‘g’ goes forward, ‘q’ goes back) 

The common use of aptitude in TUI (text user interface) is; run aptitude;
press 'u' (update the lists of available packages); press 'U' (Mark all
upgradable packages to be upgraded); (search/select some stuff to install, is
optional); press 'g' (to see the pending actions and modify if needed); press
'g' (again, to start the download).

Some time when you need to resolve conflicts, you discover that you made a
mistake; you can easily use 'Cancel pending actions' in the 'Actions' menu so
that you can re-select.

When reviewing pending actions:

    'a' explicitly accepts an action (use again to unaccept)
    'r' rejects an action
    'g' again goes ahead with pending actions 

See Accessing package information for understanding the letters in the package
synopsis line (e.g., 'i' means "will be installed", 'p' means "not installed",
etc.)

You can also use aptitude in the same manner as apt-get:

Update the packages list :

     aptitude update

Upgrade the packages :

     aptitude safe-upgrade

Install foo :

     aptitude install foo

Remove bar :

     aptitude remove bar

Purge foo :

     aptitude purge foo

#   +--------------------------+
#---| Functions for every user |---
#   +--------------------------+

Search for packaging containing foo :

     aptitude search foo

Personally, I still use apt-cache search foo to perform a search – aptitude
search foo is slower. But you should try the aptitude search foo way. You
should discover that the output is a bit different from apt-cache, in some
cases, it may be useful to search for a package to see if it is already
installed.

showing if a specific package is installed :

     aptitude show foo

#   +----------------------------------+
#---| How to upgrade your distribution |---
#   +----------------------------------+

Upgrading from one stable release to the next (e.g. Lenny to Squeeze) is done
by following the release notes for your architecture. For most people with 32
bit systems that means the Release Notes for Intel x86. For most with 64 bit
systems that means the Release Notes for AMD64.

Using full-upgrade in the regular course of events is no longer the
recommended practice (unless you are running sid, in which case you should not
need to be reading this.)

Minor release upgrades (e.g. from lenny 5.0.1 to 5.0.2) and security updates
are done with safe-upgrade.

Find out the current version of Debian that you are running: 

     cat /etc/debian_version

Example for upgrading from, e.g., etch 4.0r1 to 4.0r2 ...etc., or applying
security upgrades:

     aptitude update
     aptitude safe-upgrade

#   +---------------------+
#---| apt-get to aptitude |---
#   +---------------------+

Action

    apt-get command
    aptitude command

Install foo

    apt-get install foo
    aptitude install foo

Install foo.deb

    apt install ./foo.deb

Search foo

    apt-cache search foo
    aptitude search foo

Remove foo

    apt-get remove foo
    aptitude remove foo

List reverse dependencies

    apt-cache rdepends foo
    aptitude search ~Dfoo

Print information on priorities for foo

    apt-cache policy foo
    aptitude versions foo

Download foo's sources and build a binary .deb package

    apt-get source --compile foo
    ?

#   +--------------------------+
#---| Advanced search patterns |---
#   +--------------------------+

Looking for packages installed from anything else than stable:

    aptitude search '?narrow(?installed, !?archive(stable))'

Looking for packages installed from testing (assuming you have sources lists
with stable and testing repositories):

    aptitude search '?narrow(?installed, ?archive(testing) !?archive(stable))'

#   +---------------------+
#---| Find available apps |---
#   +---------------------+

grep-dctrl and its derivatives provide a great way to query the apt cache
files. (You can install these tools on ubuntu with sudo apt-get install
dctrl-tools )

In the case of available (but not necessarily installed) packages, you can use
grep-available. For example, to list all available packages:

    grep-available -s Package .

aptitude can show you a list of Not Installed Packages by just launching it.

You can also get a list of not installed packages with aptitude by using:

        aptitude -F "%p" search "?not(?installed)"

#   +------------------------+
#---| List what is installed |---

    Several ways..
